# GithubVisualisation

This visualisation shows important data concerning a chosen Github repository, such as:
* All files
  * Using a codeflower
* Commits
  * Using a barchart
* Code additions/removals
  * Using a shaded line chart (?)
* More?

### Usage

The user can enter a search query which gets run through the Github API and returns matching repositories.
These repositories get listed in the SVG. (picture)

The user can then click any of these listed repositories to move on with the visualisation.
The visualisation will show the overal structure of the repository by default (picture).

To switch to the second screen, dubbed "growth analysis" there will be a button at the top right of the svg.
If the user wants to switch back, there is a similar button dubbed "structure".

Underneath the SVG there will be a horizontal slider, 
allowing the user to view the data at any point of time during the repositories history.
